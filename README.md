## Motivation

I created this because the official INE certificate verification endpoints ([my.ine.com/certifications](https://my.ine.com/certifications/) or [my.ine.com/certificate/{credential_id}](https://my.ine.com/certificate/{credential_id})) are currently broken and return a 503 error. This makes it impossible for users, employers, or anyone else to verify INE certifications through the official site.

With this, anyone can verify INE certificates directly. If you need to confirm the validity of an INE credential and the official service is down, you can use this as a alternative.

## Features
- Verify any Accredible certificate by credential ID (not limited to INE)
- Fetch certificate details, verification status, and related events

## Usage

### API Endpoint

`GET /verify/{credential_id}`

Verifies a certificate by its credential ID. Returns certificate details, verification status, and related events.

      }
